            <p>
                Ans : <br>
                1. var is scope that is hoisted and it value can be reassigned. <br>
                2. let is a scope that's value can't be reassigned and it works within the block of curly brackets {}
                and its value can be reassigned. <br>
                3. const is a scope as similar as let but the difference is it's value can't be reassigned.

            <p class="text-black">Questions-2 : Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`</p>
            <p>
                Ans : <br>
                1. null is a case when a variable is declared and its value is given as null. It means the default value
                of the vairable is null. <br>
                2. undefined is a case when a variable is declared but it's value is never given. When we try to print
                that declared variable we get undefined.

            <p>
                Ans : <br>
                1. RestAPI is a http based communicator that makes a communication connection between the server and the
                user interface. whenever a user asks for any type of data the RestAPI creates a HTTP request to get the
                data from the server or to fetch or delete the data. That means the rest api can also be used to do crud
                operations with database or server. <br>
